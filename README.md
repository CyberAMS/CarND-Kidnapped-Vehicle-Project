# Project: Kidnapped Vehicle

This project has been prepared by Andre Strobel.

The goal of this project is to program a [particle filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter) in *C/C++* to demonstrate how to localize a moving vehicle in a map. The vehicle measures distances to objects which can be associated to known landmarks in the map. This self-localization is the first step in [robot navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation).

The following table shows an overview of the most important files:

### 2. Udacity Simulator

The particle filter program connects to the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) via [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets). The simulator is available for Linux, Mac and Windows.

## 2. Data objects and structures

### 1. Maps and landmarks

The map information is loaded from the file `data/map_data.txt` which has the following structure:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | x position  |
| 2      | y position  |
| 3      | landmark id |

The map object class `Map` is defined in `map.h`. The only content is a vector list `landmark_list` of landmarks `single_landmark_s` with the following data structure:

| Variable | Value or Description   |
|----------|------------------------|
| `id_i`   | landmark id as integer |
| `x_f`    | x position as float    |
| `y_f`    | y position as float    |

### 2. Particle filter and particles

The particle filter is defined as object class `ParticleFilter` in `particle_filter.{h, cpp}`. A particle filter instance contains the number of particles in `num_particles`, whether it has been initialized in `is_initialized`, a vector list `weights` containing the weights of all particles as well as a vector list `particles` for all the particles. Each particle is defined as data structure `Particle`:

| Variable       | Value or Description                                                                   |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`           | particle id as integer                                                                 |
| `x`            | x position as double                                                                   |
| `y`            | y position as double                                                                   |
| `theta`        | heading angle of particle as double                                                    |
| `weight`       | weight showing how good it associates landmarks to the observations as double          |
| `associations` | vector list of landmark ids (integers) associated to the observations                  |
| `sense_x`      | vector list of x positions (double) of the observations added to the particle position |
| `sense_y`      | vector list of y positions (double) of the observations added to the particle position |

## 3. Particle filter implementation

### 1. Primary equations

In this project the prediction step of the particle filter assumes a linear bicycle motion model.

```C
// predict state with bicycle motion model - handle zero yaw rate separately
if (fabs(yaw_rate) < ZERO_DETECTION) {
	
	// precalculations
	theta_0 = particles[current_particle].theta;
	velocity_dot = velocity * delta_t;
	
	// motion step
	particles[current_particle].x += velocity_dot * cos(theta_0);
	particles[current_particle].y += velocity_dot * sin(theta_0);
	
}
else {
	
	// precalculations
	theta_0 = particles[current_particle].theta;
	velocity_over_yaw_rate = velocity / yaw_rate;
	theta_dot = yaw_rate * delta_t;
	
	// motion step
	particles[current_particle].x += velocity_over_yaw_rate * (sin(theta_0 + theta_dot) - sin(theta_0));
	particles[current_particle].y += velocity_over_yaw_rate * (cos(theta_0) - cos(theta_0 + theta_dot));
	particles[current_particle].theta += theta_dot;
	
}
```

The distance between two points is calculated with the following function:

```C
inline double dist(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
	return sqrt((x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1));
}
```

The transformation between vehicle coordinates (observations with change/distance relative to the vehicle) and global map coordinates (particles with position as offset and heading angle alpha) is calculated with the following equations:

```C
	// transformations
	x_map = x_offset_map + (cos(alpha) * x_change_relative) - (sin(alpha) * y_change_relative);
	y_map = y_offset_map + (sin(alpha) * x_change_relative) + (cos(alpha) * y_change_relative);
```

The [multi-variate Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) is calculated with the following function:

```C
inline double mvg(double x_value, double y_value, double mu_x, double mu_y, double s_x, double s_y) {
	return (1 / (2 * M_PI * s_x * s_y)) * exp(-((pow(x_value - mu_x, 2) / (2 * pow(s_x, 2))) + (pow(y_value - mu_y, 2) / (2 * pow(s_y, 2)))));
}
```

### 2. Implementation in C/C++

At the beginning the map data is loaded in the `main.cpp` function. The `main.cpp` function connects to the simulator via [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) and receives the current observations in each step. In each step it determines the best particle by picking the one with the highest weight. It then sends the best particle's position with attached observations and associated landmark ids back to the simulator for visualization and error calculation.

The flow of the particle filter in each step is defined by the following sequence of methods:

```C
ParticleFilter pf;
...
in each step do {
	if (!pf.initialized()) {
		pf.init(...);
	}
	else {
		pf.prediction(...);
	}
	pf.UpdateWeights(...);
	pf.resample(...);
}
```

In the first step the `pf.init()` method initializes all particles with a random distribution around a first estimate for the location. The random noise is added to each particle's location with the method `addNoise()`.

The `pf.prediction()` method uses the above described linear bicycle motion model to calculate the location of all particles after the duration `delta_t`. It also adds random noise to each particle's location with the method `addNoise()`. This ensures that we consider new and potentially better particle locations in each step.

The `pf.UpdateWeights()` method executes a sequence of steps for all particles to update their weights based on the new observations (i.e. measurements). First it determines the map landmarks within the sensor range of the particle's location. Then it uses the above mentioned equations to transform the vehicle observations into global map coordinates for the particle. After this it uses the [nearest neighbor method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) to associate the observations in global map coordinates to the map landmarks within the sensor range. And finally it calculates the new weight for the particle as multiplication of the probabilities that each observation is close to the associated landmark. The [multi-variate Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) function from above is used to determine the probability that the observation in global map coordinates is equal to the associated landmark.

The `pf.resample()` method is then used to draw a new list of particles from the existing list of particles. The weight of each particle is used as probability during this drawing process. This ensures that more likely and therefore more accurate particle locations get drawn more often into the new list of particles. The new list of particles contains the same number of particles as before.

### 3. Debugging environment

In order to debug the particle filter efficiently, several methods have been added to display the content of all the input and output variables of each relevant function.

The debug options of the `main()` function are selected with the below parameters. If `bFILEOUTPUT` is `true`, the standard output is redirected into the file `out.txt`. If `bDISPLAY` is `true`, more information about input and output variables is displayed to the standard output. If `bTest` is `true`, a predefined set of inputs is used to run and check the particle filter instead of connecting it to the simulator environment.

```C
const bool bFILEOUTPUT = false;
const bool bDISPLAY = false;
const bool bTEST = false;
```

Inside the particle filter object, all methods can display their input and output variables to the standard output. The parameter `bDISPLAY` must be `true` to enable any of these features. The debugging feature of each particle filter method can be turned on by setting the parameter `bDISPLAY_<name of method>` to `true`. The available method names are listed below.

```C
const bool bDISPLAY = false;
const bool bDISPLAY_init = true;
const bool bDISPLAY_prediction = true;
const bool bDISPLAY_dataAssociation = false;
const bool bDISPLAY_updateWeights = true;
const bool bDISPLAY_resample = true;
const bool bDISPLAY_SetAssociations = false;
const bool bDISPLAY_addNoise = false;
const bool bDISPLAY_getMapLandmark = false;
const bool bDISPLAY_transformVehicle2Map = false;
```

The following methods are used to convert the variable contents into a single string that can be displayed:

```C
std::string createDoubleVectorString(std::vector<double> double_vector);
std::string createIntegerVectorString(std::vector<int> int_vector);
std::string createArrayString(double array[], unsigned int num_elements);
std::string createParticleString(Particle particle);
std::string createParticlesString(std::vector<Particle> particles);
std::string createLandmarkString(LandmarkObs landmark);
std::string createLandmarksString(std::vector<LandmarkObs> landmarks);
std::string createMapString(Map map);
```

## 4. Execution with given input data

### 1. Commands to start the simulation

The program is compiled using the `.\build.sh` command. After this it can be started using the `.\run.sh` command. Once the program is running and listening on port 4567 the simulator can be started.

### 2. Simulation results

I tested the particle filter with 5, 20 and 100 particles. The animations below show the simulator output for each variant from left to right. Due to the very good first estimate, the particle filter works great with either setting. I settled on 20 particles to balance efficiency and potentially more complicated scenarios than the given example.

For the case with 20 particles the below picture series shows several different scenarios for vehicle versus landmark locations. It is also shown that the particle filter passes the test at the end.

The debugging output of the 20 particle run is zipped in [./out.zip](./out.zip).

## 5. Discussion

Sometimes the particle filter doesn't associate the observations to the considered landmarks correctly. This is shown by a longer red line from the end of a blue line (best particle with observation) to the wrongly associated landmark. This happens, because the best particle location doesn't exactly match the vehicle position and the observations are also noisy. The particle filter looks for landmarks in the map that are exactly within the sensor range of the particle. Therefore, observations can include landmarks that are just outside of the sensor range. As they are not included in the considered landmarks, a wrong association is made. Typically, this is only the case for a few timesteps while passing a landmark just about in sensor range.

Below are two examples to visualize the issue. The center image shows the step when the observation is associated to the wrong landmark. The left and right images show the situation slightly before and after this. It is clear that this only happens for a very short time.

Easy solutions are to consider more particles which leads to a more precise estimation of the actual vehicle's position as well as considering landmarks that are outside of the actual sensor range. I propose to extend the distance by 10 percent, i.e. the used range is 1.1 times the sensor range. This will eliminate most of the wrong landmark associations.
